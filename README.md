(Baekjoon Online Judge)

It is an **algorithm training site** founded by Choi Baekjoon in 2010. There are many exercises which can help solving problem, learning algorithms and so on. In this repository, my own solution for the exercises will be uploaded. The programming language mainly would be the following.
* C
* C++
* Python 3

If needed, text file(.md) which explains specific algorithms will be uploaded additionally.
